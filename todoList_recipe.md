# TodoList Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects._

```python
# File: lib/todo_list.py
class TodoList:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def add(self, todo):
        # Parameters:
        #   todo: an instance of Todo
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects:
        #   Adds the todo to the list of todos
        pass

    def incomplete(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A list of Todo instances representing the todos that are not complete
        pass

    def complete(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A list of Todo instances representing the todos that are complete
        pass

    def give_up(self):
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects:
        #   Marks all todos as complete
        pass
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

``` python
# EXAMPLE

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
